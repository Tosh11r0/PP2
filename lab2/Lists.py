#List
#Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
#Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist)

"""
List Items
List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc. 
"""

""" 
ORDERED
When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.

Changeable
The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.

Allow Duplicates
Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value:
"""

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry"]
print(thislist)

#To determine how many items a list has, use the len() function:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(len(thislist))

#List items can be of any data type:
list1 = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
list2 = [1, 5, 7, 9, 3]
list3 = [True, False, False]

#A list can contain different data types:
list1 = ["abc", 34, True, 40, "male"]

#From Python's perspective, lists are defined as objects with the data type 'list':
mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(type(mylist))

#The list() Constructor
#It is also possible to use the list() constructor when creating a new list.
thislist = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
print(thislist)








# Python - ACCESS LIST ITEMS

# List items are indexed and you can access them by referring to the index number:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist[1])  # Outputs: banana

# Note: The first item has index 0.

# Negative Indexing:
# Negative indexing means start from the end. -1 refers to the last item, -2 refers to the second last item, and so on.
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist[-1])  # Outputs: cherry

# Range of Indexes:
# You can specify a range of indexes by specifying where to start and where to end the range.
# When specifying a range, the return value will be a new list with the specified items.
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]
print(thislist[2:5])  # Outputs: ['cherry', 'orange', 'kiwi']

# Note: The search will start at index 2 (included) and end at index 5 (not included).
# Remember that the first item has index 0.

# By leaving out the start value, the range will start at the first item:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]
print(thislist[:4])  # Outputs: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange']

# By leaving out the end value, the range will go on to the end of the list:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]
print(thislist[2:])  # Outputs: ['cherry', 'orange', 'kiwi', 'melon', 'mango']

# Range of Negative Indexes:
# Specify negative indexes if you want to start the search from the end of the list:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]
print(thislist[-4:-1])  # Outputs: ['orange', 'kiwi', 'melon']

# Check if Item Exists:
# To determine if a specified item is present in a list, use the 'in' keyword:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
if "apple" in thislist:
    print("Yes, 'apple' is in the fruits list")  # Outputs: Yes, 'apple' is in the fruits list









# Python - Ð¡HANGE LIST ITEMS

# To change the value of a specific item, refer to the index number:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist[1] = "blackcurrant"
print(thislist)  # Outputs: ['apple', 'blackcurrant', 'cherry']

# To change the value of items within a specific range, define a list with the new values,
# and refer to the range of index numbers where you want to insert the new values:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "mango"]
thislist[1:3] = ["blackcurrant", "watermelon"]
print(thislist)  # Outputs: ['apple', 'blackcurrant', 'watermelon', 'orange', 'kiwi', 'mango']

# If you insert more items than you replace, the new items will be inserted where you specified,
# and the remaining items will move accordingly:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist[1:2] = ["blackcurrant", "watermelon"]
print(thislist)  # Outputs: ['apple', 'blackcurrant', 'watermelon', 'cherry']

# Note: The length of the list will change when the number of items inserted does not match the number of items replaced.

# If you insert fewer items than you replace, the new items will be inserted where you specified,
# and the remaining items will move accordingly:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist[1:3] = ["watermelon"]
print(thislist)  # Outputs: ['apple', 'watermelon']

# To insert a new list item, without replacing any of the existing values, we can use the insert() method.
# The insert() method inserts an item at the specified index:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.insert(2, "watermelon")
print(thislist)  # Outputs: ['apple', 'banana', 'watermelon', 'cherry']

# Note: As a result of the example above, the list will now contain 4 items.





# Python - ADD LIST ITEMS

# Append Items
# To add an item to the end of the list, use the append() method:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.append("orange")
print(thislist)  # Outputs: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange']

# Insert Items
# To insert a list item at a specified index, use the insert() method.
# The insert() method inserts an item at the specified index:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.insert(1, "orange")
print(thislist)  # Outputs: ['apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'cherry']

# Note: As a result of the examples above, the lists will now contain 4 items.

# Extend List
# To append elements from another list to the current list, use the extend() method.
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
tropical = ["mango", "pineapple", "papaya"]
thislist.extend(tropical)
print(thislist)  # Outputs: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'mango', 'pineapple', 'papaya']

# The elements will be added to the end of the list.

# Add Any Iterable
# The extend() method does not have to append lists, you can add any iterable object (tuples, sets, dictionaries etc.).
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thistuple = ("kiwi", "orange")
thislist.extend(thistuple)
print(thislist)  # Outputs: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'kiwi', 'orange']



# Python - Remove List Items

# Remove Specified Item
# The remove() method removes the specified item.
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.remove("banana")
print(thislist)  # Outputs: ['apple', 'cherry']

# If there are more than one item with the specified value, the remove() method removes the first occurrence.
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "banana", "kiwi"]
thislist.remove("banana")
print(thislist)  # Outputs: ['apple', 'cherry', 'banana', 'kiwi']

# Remove Specified Index
# The pop() method removes the specified index.
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.pop(1)
print(thislist)  # Outputs: ['apple', 'cherry']

# If you do not specify the index, the pop() method removes the last item.
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.pop()
print(thislist)  # Outputs: ['apple', 'banana']

# The del keyword also removes the specified index.
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
del thislist[0]
print(thislist)  # Outputs: ['banana', 'cherry']

# The del keyword can also delete the list completely.
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
del thislist
# print(thislist)  # This will raise an error because "thislist" no longer exists.

# Clear the List
# The clear() method empties the list. The list still remains, but it has no content.
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.clear()
print(thislist)  # Outputs: []



# Python - Loop Lists

# Loop Through a List
# You can loop through the list items by using a for loop:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in thislist:
    print(x)
# Output:
# apple
# banana
# cherry

# Loop Through the Index Numbers
# You can also loop through the list items by referring to their index number.
# Use the range() and len() functions to create a suitable iterable.
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for i in range(len(thislist)):
    print(thislist[i])
# Output:
# apple
# banana
# cherry

# Using a While Loop
# You can loop through the list items by using a while loop.
# Use the len() function to determine the length of the list,
# then start at 0 and loop your way through the list items by referring to their indexes.
# Remember to increase the index by 1 after each iteration.
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
i = 0
while i < len(thislist):
    print(thislist[i])
    i += 1
# Output:
# apple
# banana
# cherry

# Looping Using List Comprehension
# List Comprehension offers the shortest syntax for looping through lists:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
[print(x) for x in thislist]
# Output:
# apple
# banana
# cherry





# Python - List Comprehension

# List comprehension offers a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an existing list.

# Example:
# Based on a list of fruits, you want a new list containing only the fruits with the letter "a" in the name.

# Without list comprehension, you will have to write a for statement with a conditional test inside:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
newlist = []
for x in fruits:
    if "a" in x:
        newlist.append(x)
print(newlist)  # Outputs: ['apple', 'banana', 'mango']

# With list comprehension, you can do all that with only one line of code:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
newlist = [x for x in fruits if "a" in x]
print(newlist)  # Outputs: ['apple', 'banana', 'mango']

# The Syntax:
# newlist = [expression for item in iterable if condition == True]

# The return value is a new list, leaving the old list unchanged.

# Condition:
# The condition is like a filter that only accepts the items that evaluate to True.

# Example:
# Only accept items that are not "apple":
newlist = [x for x in fruits if x != "apple"]
print(newlist)  # Outputs: ['banana', 'cherry', 'kiwi', 'mango']

# The condition is optional and can be omitted:
newlist = [x for x in fruits]
print(newlist)  # Outputs: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'kiwi', 'mango']

# Iterable:
# The iterable can be any iterable object, like a list, tuple, set, etc.

# Example:
# You can use the range() function to create an iterable:
newlist = [x for x in range(10)]
print(newlist)  # Outputs: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# Same example, but with a condition:
# Accept only numbers lower than 5:
newlist = [x for x in range(10) if x < 5]
print(newlist)  # Outputs: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

# Expression:
# The expression is the current item in the iteration, but it is also the outcome,
# which you can manipulate before it ends up like a list item in the new list.

# Example:
# Set the values in the new list to upper case:
newlist = [x.upper() for x in fruits]
print(newlist)  # Outputs: ['APPLE', 'BANANA', 'CHERRY', 'KIWI', 'MANGO']

# You can set the outcome to whatever you like:
# Example:
# Set all values in the new list to 'hello':
newlist = ['hello' for x in fruits]
print(newlist)  # Outputs: ['hello', 'hello', 'hello', 'hello', 'hello']

# The expression can also contain conditions, not like a filter, but as a way to manipulate the outcome:
# Example:
# Return "orange" instead of "banana":
newlist = [x if x != "banana" else "orange" for x in fruits]
print(newlist)  # Outputs: ['apple', 'orange', 'cherry', 'kiwi', 'mango']






# Python - Sort Lists

# Sort List Alphanumerically
# List objects have a sort() method that will sort the list alphanumerically, ascending, by default:
thislist = ["orange", "mango", "kiwi", "pineapple", "banana"]
thislist.sort()
print(thislist)  # Outputs: ['banana', 'kiwi', 'mango', 'orange', 'pineapple']

# Sort the list numerically:
thislist = [100, 50, 65, 82, 23]
thislist.sort()
print(thislist)  # Outputs: [23, 50, 65, 82, 100]

# Sort Descending
# To sort descending, use the keyword argument reverse = True:
thislist = ["orange", "mango", "kiwi", "pineapple", "banana"]
thislist.sort(reverse=True)
print(thislist)  # Outputs: ['pineapple', 'orange', 'mango', 'kiwi', 'banana']

# Sort the list descending:
thislist = [100, 50, 65, 82, 23]
thislist.sort(reverse=True)
print(thislist)  # Outputs: [100, 82, 65, 50, 23]

# Customize Sort Function
# You can also customize your own function by using the keyword argument key = function.
# The function will return a number that will be used to sort the list (the lowest number first):
def myfunc(n):
    return abs(n - 50)

thislist = [100, 50, 65, 82, 23]
thislist.sort(key=myfunc)
print(thislist)  # Outputs: [50, 65, 23, 82, 100]

# Case Insensitive Sort
# By default the sort() method is case sensitive, resulting in all capital letters being sorted before lower case letters:
thislist = ["banana", "Orange", "Kiwi", "cherry"]
thislist.sort()
print(thislist)  # Outputs: ['Kiwi', 'Orange', 'banana', 'cherry']

# Luckily we can use built-in functions as key functions when sorting a list.
# So if you want a case-insensitive sort function, use str.lower as a key function:
thislist = ["banana", "Orange", "Kiwi", "cherry"]
thislist.sort(key=str.lower)
print(thislist)  # Outputs: ['banana', 'cherry', 'Kiwi', 'Orange']

# Reverse Order
# What if you want to reverse the order of a list, regardless of the alphabet?
# The reverse() method reverses the current sorting order of the elements.
thislist = ["banana", "Orange", "Kiwi", "cherry"]
thislist.reverse()
print(thislist)  # Outputs: ['cherry', 'Kiwi', 'Orange', 'banana']



# Python - Copy Lists

# You cannot copy a list simply by typing list2 = list1, because:
# list2 will only be a reference to list1, and changes made in list1 will automatically also be made in list2.

# Use the copy() method
# You can use the built-in List method copy() to copy a list.
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
mylist = thislist.copy()
print(mylist)  # Outputs: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

# Use the list() method
# Another way to make a copy is to use the built-in method list().
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
mylist = list(thislist)
print(mylist)  # Outputs: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

# Use the slice operator
# You can also make a copy of a list by using the slice operator [:].
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
mylist = thislist[:]
print(mylist)  # Outputs: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']



# Python - Join Lists

# There are several ways to join, or concatenate, two or more lists in Python.

# 1. Using the + operator:
# One of the easiest ways is by using the + operator.
list1 = ["a", "b", "c"]
list2 = [1, 2, 3]
list3 = list1 + list2
print(list3)  # Outputs: ['a', 'b', 'c', 1, 2, 3]

# 2. Appending all items from one list into another:
# Another way to join two lists is by appending all the items from list2 into list1, one by one.
list1 = ["a", "b", "c"]
list2 = [1, 2, 3]
for x in list2:
    list1.append(x)
print(list1)  # Outputs: ['a', 'b', 'c', 1, 2, 3]

# 3. Using the extend() method:
# Or you can use the extend() method, which purpose is to add elements from one list to another list.
list1 = ["a", "b", "c"]
list2 = [1, 2, 3]
list1.extend(list2)
print(list1)  # Outputs: ['a', 'b', 'c', 1, 2, 3]



# Python List Methods
